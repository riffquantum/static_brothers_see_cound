Ambisonic impulse responses
===========================

In the ambisonic files the start of the file corresponds
exactly to the direct sound impulse. This has been removed,
assuming the dry sound will be mixed in separately. So the
first few ms will be silent.

Measurements in the outer cylinder
----------------------------------

For all IRs, the source was in the front direction, near
the wall and close to the ground. 

#11: Mic near the wall to the right.
#12: Mic at the center.
#14: Mic at the back.

In all cases the front side of the mic was towards
the speaker


Measurements in the sphere
--------------------------

Inside the sphere a grid is installed at about 1/4 of the
height, providing a floor to walk on, with an aperture at
the center allowing entry. For all IRs the mic was held
on a boom near the center of the sphere, facing a random
horizontal direction.

#16: Speaker on the grid i.e. below the mic, facing up.
#17: Speaker at about half height, near the wall, facing
the mic.
#18: Speaker at about half height, near the wall, facing
the wall.
