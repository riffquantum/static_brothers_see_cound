TO DO:

Write some kind of limiter that can react to input and prevent clipping during many simulatenous events
	One option to protect against that is to have everything work at a very low volume so that we have lots of headroom for simultaneous events and then amplify it at the end
		A fast way to that is to change the value of 0dbsf by an order of magnitude.

Write some sequencing/scheduling instruments that can replace current score usage and allow for faster beat composition and more powerful programming capabilities. 

Find a solution for instrument interruption in realtime MIDI situations (IE hi hat closure)

Improve responsiveness of real time MIDI input
