## Static Brothers
### CSound Project Take 1
### Joe Hughes and Quinn McCord

This is the Static Brothers' CSound application for composition and performance. 

TO DO:
* Write some kind of limiter that can clipping during many simulatenous events for the final output.
-- The urgency of this has been mitigated. I changed the default value of 0dbsf by an order of magnitude thus giving every file a lot more head room.
	

* Find a solution for instrument interruption in realtime MIDI situations (IE hi hat closure)

* Improve responsiveness of real time MIDI input

* Write a BPM setter instrument that can change the global BPM variable at different points in the score. This might mean changing the BPM variable to k rate.

* Effects
	- reverb
	- delay
	- echo
	- chorus
	- distortion
